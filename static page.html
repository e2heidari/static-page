        <h1>CSS Tools: Reset CSS</h1>
        <p>The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights,
            margins and font sizes of headings, and so on. The general reasoning behind this was discussed in a May
            2007
            post, if you're interested. Reset styles quite often appear in CSS frameworks, and the original
            "meyerweb
            reset" found its way into Blueprint, among others.</p>

        <p>The reset styles given here are intentionally very generic. There isn't any default color or background
            set
            for the body element, for example. I don't particularly recommend that you just use this in its
            unaltered
            state in your own projects. It should be tweaked, edited, extended, and otherwise tuned to match your
            specific reset baseline. Fill in your preferred colors for the page, links, and so on.</p>

        <p>In other words, this is a starting point, not a self-contained black box of no-touchiness.</p>

        <p>If you want to use my reset styles, then feel free! It's all explicitly in the public domain (I have to
            formally say that or else people ask me about licensing). You can grab a copy of the file to use and
            tweak
            as fits you best. If you're more of the copy-and-paste type, or just want an in-page preview of what
            you'll
            be getting, here it is.</p>
        <p>and hold forth on subjects such as CSS, Web design, Web standards, Web browsers, and how they all go
            together. He's comfortable with talking theory and giving "big picture" overviews, and also with
            exploring
            practical solutions that will be of immediate interest to his audience. Recent speaking topics have
            included:</p>

        <p>Designing with empathy and forethought
            Using CSS for advanced layout
            The business benefits of using web standards properly
